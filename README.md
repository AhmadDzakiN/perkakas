Library for supporting common backend tasks. If you have function that considered common, please move it here.

How to develop on perkakas:
1. Any common function that **does not have any business logic** can be moved here.
2. You should group your function into a folder as a package.
3. If the folder not exist, just create it. If the folder exist, put your code there.

$ go get https://github.com/kitabisa/perkakas/v2
